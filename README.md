This tool works interactively like `less` command on small pane within the terminal window.  
And leave the output on the terminal when quit like `cat` command.

-s, --start START        set start line of data at startup
-t, --tab-width WIDTH    set tab width
-N, --print-line-number  print line numbers
-f, --follow             output appended data as the file grows

## Commands
**Format**  

```
KEY-BIND            OPERATION
```

**Example 1**  

```
0 Ctr-a             Go to the beggining of line
```
Type `0` OR `Ctrl-a`, then `Go to the beggining of line`.

**Example 2**  

```
(num)+              Increment screen height
```
`(num)` means that entering a number is optional.  
If you omit the number input, the number will be processed as 1.

```
[num]=              Set screen height to [num]
```
`[num]` means that entering a number is mandatory.
